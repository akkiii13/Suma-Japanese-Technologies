            identification, where it is practical. Certain sections of the

          <h3>1. Personal data that we collect</h3>
          <p>
            Personal data refers to data that lets SJT know the specifics of who
            you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you
            (e.g., name, age, gender, mailing address, telephone number and
            e-mail address). We collect your personal data which you provide us,
            inter alia, in scenarios such as- (i) in response to a survey; (ii)
            in case you register for events; (iii) when registering for
            personalised services; or (iv) requesting information about our
            product or use of our services or request for customer support etc.
            We may ask you to provide your personal data relevant for the
            scenarios such as your name, address, zip code, phone number, email
            address and collect your IP address, location data, information
            about your device, etc. Not all of the personal data SJT holds about
            you, will always come directly from you. It may, for example, come
            from your employer or other organizations to which you belong or
            through our retail network and preferred partners. However, SJT
            collects personal data about you when you interact with this site
            and/or utilize products or services offered on this site. For
            example:

          <ul>
            <li>
              If you apply for a job or other staffing opportunity through this
              site, you will be asked to submit your resume and as well as other
              contact information such as your email address, phone number and
              mailing address. We will use this information to consider you for
              the job opening that you specify. We may also use this information
              to contact you regarding other staffing opportunities, both
              opportunities advertised on this site.

            of data privacy protection. For example, we use approved contractual
            clauses, multiparty data transfer agreements, intragroup agreements,
            and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your
            personal data/information protect it.
