                <p>
                    We take steps to ensure that the information we collect is processed according to this Privacy
                    Policy and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located. SJT has networks,
                    databases, servers, systems, support, and help desks located throughout our offices around the
                    world. We collaborate with third parties such as cloud hosting services, suppliers, and technology
                    support located around the world to serve the needs of our business, workforce, and customers. We
                    take appropriate steps so that personal data is processed, secured, and transferred according to
                    applicable law.

                    or transfer your personal data within SJT or to third parties, if required. When we transfer
                    personal data/information to other countries in which applicable laws do not offer the same level of
                    data privacy protection as in your home country, we take measures to provide an appropriate level of
                    data privacy protection. For example, we use approved contractual clauses, multiparty data transfer
                    agreements, intragroup agreements, and other measures designed to ensure that the recipients of your
                    personal data/information protect it.

                    database by sending an e-mail request. Upon receiving the request, SJT shall ensure to delete such
